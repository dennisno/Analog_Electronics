\subsection{Energy}
Energy is the ability to perform work. The unit, Joules, is expressed by:
\begin{equation}
    J = \frac{kg \times m^2}{s^2}
\end{equation}
In mechanics energy is usually thought of as either potential or kinetic, from 
gravity or motion respectfully. In electronics we usually talk about energy in 
terms of chemical potential energy in batteries or in terms of power.
\subsection{Power}
Power is the rate of energy, work per time:
\begin{equation}
    P = \frac{J}{s}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Watts Law}
When pushing current through a resistor or resistive circuit power is converted
to heat or light. The amount of power consumed is directly proportional to both 
voltage(pressure) and current(amount of water):
\begin{equation}
    P = V*I = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2R
\end{equation}
